### **FULL PRESENTATION SCRIPT:**

**Opening Statement:**
"Now let's talk about the most critical part of our study—**How do we actually measure if the brain is working?** We cannot ask mice to solve equations or take IQ tests, right? So we use **standardized behavioral assessments** that have been validated extensively in neuroscience research."

---

### **Test 1: Novel Object Recognition (NOR)**

**[Point to the left panel - NOR]**

"First, we have the **Novel Object Recognition test**—our **primary cognitive assessment**.

**The Concept:** This test measures **Recognition Memory**—the ability to remember 'I've seen this before.'

**The Natural Behavior:** Mice, like all mammals, are naturally curious creatures. If you show them something **new**, they will spend more time exploring it compared to something **familiar**—but ONLY if they **remember** seeing the familiar object before!

**The Protocol:**
- **Day 20 (Training Phase):** We place the mouse in an open arena with **two identical objects**—let's say, two small blocks. The mouse explores both freely for 10 minutes. This is the 'learning' phase.
- **24 hours later - Day 21 (Testing Phase):** We replace ONE of the familiar objects with a **novel object**—maybe a small bottle. Now we have: 1 familiar block + 1 novel bottle.

**What Happens:**
- **A healthy mouse** with good memory will remember the block and will spend **more time exploring the novel bottle** because, 'Oh! This is new!'
- **A diabetic mouse** with impaired memory will explore both objects equally—because it has **forgotten** seeing the block yesterday. Everything seems 'new' to its damaged brain.

**Scientific Parameter - Discrimination Index (DI):**
We calculate this as:

**DI = (Time with Novel Object − Time with Familiar Object) / Total Exploration Time**

| Mouse Status | Expected DI | Interpretation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Healthy Brain** | **Positive** (0.2 to 0.5) | Prefers novel → Good memory |
| **Diabetic Brain** | **Near Zero** | No preference → Memory loss |
| **Our Treated Mice** | **Should improve!** | Recovery of recognition memory |

**Analogy Connection:**
Think of it like this: If the wedding guests (neurons) are healthy and alert, they'll remember their old friends and get excited about meeting NEW guests. But if they're starved and confused (diabetes), they can't even recognize who they met yesterday!

**Outcome Measured:** Recognition memory, Discrimination index (DI)"

### **Test 2: Elevated Plus Maze (EPM)**

**[Point to the center panel - EPM]**

"Next, we have the **Elevated Plus Maze**—this measures **anxiety-like behavior**.

**The Apparatus:** Picture a giant '+' sign raised about 50 cm above the ground. Two arms are **open** (exposed, no walls), and two arms are **closed** (enclosed with walls).

**The Natural Behavior:** Mice have a natural conflict:
1. They **love exploring** (innate curiosity)
2. But they **fear open, exposed spaces** (predator avoidance instinct)

**What We Measure:**
- **Open arm time:** How long does the mouse dare to venture into the open arms?
- **Open arm entries:** How many times does it enter the open arms?
- **Closed arm entries:** This tells us about general locomotor activity

**Interpretation:**
- **High anxiety mouse:** Stays mostly in closed arms (safe zones)
- **Low anxiety/normal mouse:** Explores both open and closed arms
- **Diabetic mice** often show altered anxiety patterns

**Why This Test Matters:**
This is our **control test**. We want to make sure that any memory improvement we see in NOR is **truly cognitive**—not just because the mouse is less anxious or more willing to explore. It helps us rule out confounding factors.

**Supporting Parameter:** Anxiety-like behavior, locomotor control
**Outcome Measured:** 
- Open arm time
- Open arm entries
- Closed arm entries (supporting parameter, locomotor control)"

### **Test 3: Open Field Test (OFT)**

**[Point to the right panel - OFT]**

"Finally, we have the **Open Field Test**—this assesses **locomotion and general exploratory behavior**.

**The Setup:** A simple square arena (like a large open box) with defined zones: **peripheral zone** (near walls) and **center zone** (middle area).

**What We Measure:**
- **Locomotion:** Total distance moved during a **5-minute session**
- **Exploration:** How much does the mouse explore different areas?
- **Total distance moved:** Overall motor activity
- **Center time / Rearing:** Vertical exploration (standing on hind legs)—this indicates curiosity and alertness

**Why This Test Matters:**
This is our **baseline motor function check**. We need to ensure:
1. The mouse is **physically capable** of moving normally
2. Any memory deficit in NOR is not due to **inability to move** or explore
3. The formulation doesn't cause sedation or hyperactivity

**Interpretation:**
- **Normal mouse:** Explores actively, covers good distance
- **Motor-impaired mouse:** Barely moves, low distance
- **Diabetic mice** might show reduced exploratory behavior due to systemic illness

**Outcome Measured:**
- Locomotion + exploration
- 5-min session
- Total distance moved
- Center time / rearing (vertical exploration)"

### **Integration - Why All Three Tests?**

**[Make eye contact with audience, wrap up]**

"So why do we perform **all three tests** instead of just one?

**The Scientific Rigor:**
1. **NOR** = Primary endpoint → Measures **cognitive function** (memory)
2. **EPM** = Secondary control → Rules out **anxiety confounds**
3. **OFT** = Baseline control → Rules out **motor/locomotor deficits**

This **triangulation approach** ensures that when we see improvement in NOR (memory), we can confidently say:
- It's NOT because the mouse is less anxious
- It's NOT because the mouse can suddenly move better
- It's because the **brain's memory circuits** are genuinely protected!

This is called a **comprehensive behavioral battery**—the gold standard in neuropharmacology research.

**Testing Timeline:**
| Day | Test | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| **Day 18** | OFT | Baseline locomotion check |
| **Day 19** | EPM | Anxiety assessment |
| **Day 20** | NOR Training | Learning phase |
| **Day 21** | NOR Test | Memory assessment (Primary endpoint) |

All tests are non-invasive, well-validated, and approved by ethical guidelines."

### **Closing Statement:**

"These three tests together give us a **complete behavioral profile**. If our polyherbal formulation works, we should see:
- ✅ **Improved DI in NOR** (better memory) ← PRIMARY GOAL
- ✅ **Normalized EPM behavior** (reduced anxiety)
- ✅ **Maintained OFT activity** (no locomotor side effects)

This multi-dimensional assessment ensures our conclusions are robust and scientifically sound."

### **Analogy Summary (Optional, if time permits):**

"Going back to our Wedding analogy:
- **NOR** = Do the guests remember who they met yesterday? (Memory Test)
- **EPM** = Are the guests too scared to mingle? (Anxiety Test)
- **OFT** = Can the guests physically walk around? (Motor Test)

We need all three to understand the complete picture!"

**Transition to Next Slide:**
"With these behavioral tests completed, we then move to the biochemical and molecular analysis to understand the **mechanisms** behind these behavioral improvements..."

## **Key Speaking Tips:**

1. **Use hand gestures** when describing each apparatus
2. **Emphasize "Why?"** - Always explain the scientific rationale
3. **Connect to analogy** - Keep the Wedding Buffet theme alive
4. **Maintain eye contact** during interpretation sections
5. **Speak with confidence** - These are standard, well-accepted tests
6. **Pace yourself** - Don't rush through the technical details

## **Anticipated Questions & Answers:**

**Q1: Why not use Morris Water Maze instead of NOR?**
*A: Great question! Morris Water Maze is indeed a powerful test for spatial memory, but it's more stressful (forced swimming) and requires longer training. NOR is non-stressful, single-trial learning, and specifically targets recognition memory—which is one of the earliest deficits in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Plus, it's more humane and ethically preferred.*

**Q2: What is the inter-trial interval for NOR?**
*A: We use a 24-hour retention interval—this tests long-term memory consolidation rather than short-term working memory.*

**Q3: How do you ensure the objects are equally interesting?**
*A: Excellent point! We conduct pilot tests to ensure the objects have similar baseline exploration times. We also counterbalance—so for some mice, Object A is the novel one, and for others, Object B is novel. This controls for object preference bias.*

**Q4: What if a mouse doesn't explore at all?**
*A: Mice that don't meet minimum exploration criteria (usually <5 seconds total exploration time) are excluded from analysis as per standard protocols. However, this is rare with proper habituation.*
